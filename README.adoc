Eventuate Tram is a platform that solves the distributed data management problems inherent in a http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html[microservice architecture].

It is described in more detail in my book https://www.manning.com/books/microservice-patterns[Microservice Patterns] and the http://eventuate.io/tram/gettingstarted.html[getting started guide].

== How it works

Eventuate Tram provides several messaging abstractions:

* messaging - send and receive messages over named channels
* events - publish domain events and subscribe to domain events
* commands - asynchronously send a command to a service and receive a reply

Eventuate Tram messaging implements the http://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Transactional Outbox pattern].
An message producer inserts events into an `OUTBOX` table as part of the ACID transaction that updates data, such as JPA entities.
A separate message relay (a.k.a. CDC service) publishes messages to the message broker.

The message relay works in one of two ways:

* http://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html[Transaction log tailing] - currently implemented for MySQL and Postgres WAL
* https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html[Polling] - for other databases

== Supported technologies

Languages:

* Spring Boot
* .NET - forthcoming, see https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-dotnet[this project].

Databases:

* MySQL - transaction log tailing using the MySQL binlog
* Postgres - transaction log tailing using the Postgres WAL
* Other databases including Microsoft SQL server - polling

Message brokers:

* Apache Kafka
* ActiveMQ
* RabbitMQ
* Redis Streams

== Need support?

Take a look at the http://eventuate.io/support.html[available paid support] options.

== Transactional messaging

Send a message using `MessageProducer`:

```java
public interface MessageProducer {
  void send(String destination, Message message);
}
```

Receive messages using:

```java
public interface MessageConsumer {
  void subscribe(String subscriberId, Set<String> channels, MessageHandler handler);
}
```

See this example of https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/eventuate-tram-examples-common/src/main/java/io/eventuate/tram/examples/basic/messages/AbstractTramMessageTest.java[transactional messaging].

=== Transactional domain events

The domain event package builds on the core APIs.

Publish domain events using the `DomainEventPublisher` interface:

```java
public interface DomainEventPublisher {

  void publish(String aggregateType, Object aggregateId, List<DomainEvent> domainEvents);
  ...
```

Subscribe to domain events using a `DomainEventDispatcher`:

```java
public class DomainEventDispatcher {
    public DomainEventDispatcher(String eventDispatcherId,
                DomainEventHandlers eventHandlers,
                ...) {
...
}
```

Handle the events using `DomainEventHandlers`:

```java
public class RestaurantOrderEventConsumer {

  public DomainEventHandlers domainEventHandlers() {
    return DomainEventHandlersBuilder
            .forAggregateType("net.chrisrichardson.ftgo.restaurantservice.Restaurant")
            .onEvent(RestaurantMenuRevised.class, this::reviseMenu)
            .build();
  }

  public void reviseMenu(DomainEventEnvelope<RestaurantMenuRevised> de) {
```

See this example of https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/eventuate-tram-examples-common/src/main/java/io/eventuate/tram/examples/basic/events/AbstractTramEventTest.java[transaction events].

== Transactional commands

Transaction commands are implemented using transactional messaging.

Send a command using a `CommandProducer`:

```java
public interface CommandProducer {
  String send(String channel, Command command, String replyTo, Map<String, String> headers);
  ...
}
```

Subscribe to commands using a `CommandDispatcher`:

```java
public class CommandDispatcher {

  public CommandDispatcher(String commandDispatcherId,
           CommandHandlers commandHandlers) {
  ...
}
```

Handle commands and send a reply using `CommandHandlers`:

```java
public class OrderCommandHandlers {


  public CommandHandlers commandHandlers() {
    return CommandHandlersBuilder
          .fromChannel("orderService")
          .onMessage(ApproveOrderCommand.class, this::approveOrder)
          ...
          .build();
  }

  public Message approveOrder(CommandMessage<ApproveOrderCommand> cm) {
    ApproveOrderCommand command = cm.getCommand();
    ...
  }

```

See this example of https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/eventuate-tram-examples-common/src/main/java/io/eventuate/tram/examples/basic/commands/AbstractTramCommandTest.java[transactional commands].

* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-in-memory:$eventuateTramVersion` - In-memory JDBC database and in-memory messaging for testing

== Running the CDC service

In addition to a database and message broker, you will need to run the Eventuate Tram CDC service.
It reads events inserted into the database and publishes them to the message broker.
It is written using Spring Boot.
The easiest way to run this service during development is to use Docker Compose.
The https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic[Eventuate Tram Code Basic examples] project has an example docker-compose.yml file.
